# plugin-template.nvim

[![Integration][integration-badge]][integration-runs]

A template to create Neovim plugins written in [Lua][lua]

## Using

Clone/download it locally and change the references to `my_awesome_plugin`, 
`my_cool_module` accordingly to your new plugin name.

You'll need to install [Lua][lua] and [LuaRocks][luarocks] to run the linter.

## Testing

This uses [busted][busted], [luassert][luassert] (both through
[plenary.nvim][plenary]) and [matcher_combinators][matcher_combinators] to
define tests in `test/spec/` directory. These dependencies are required only to run
tests, thatÂ´s why they are installed as git submodules.
To run them just execute

```bash
$ make -C ./test test
```

If you have [entr(1)][entr] installed you may use it to run all tests whenever a
file is changed using:

```bash
$ make -C ./test watch
```

## Github actions

An Action will run all the tests and the linter on every commit on the main
branch and also on Pull Request. Tests will be run using [stable and nightly][neovim-test-versions]
versions of Neovim.
